                        <h1>About Pesticides</h1>
                        <p>Pesticides are substances that are used to control pests.[1] They include herbicides, insecticides, nematicides, fungicides, and many others (see table).[2] The most common of these are herbicides, which account for approximately 50% of all pesticide use globally.[3] Most pesticides are used as plant protection products (also known as crop protection products), which in general protect plants from weeds, fungi, or insects. In general, a pesticide is a chemical or biological agent (such as a virus, bacterium, or fungus) that deters, incapacitates, kills, or otherwise discourages pests. Target pests can include insects, plant pathogens, weeds, molluscs, birds, mammals, fish, nematodes (roundworms), and microbes that destroy property, cause nuisance, or spread disease, or are disease vectors. Along with these benefits, pesticides also have drawbacks, such as potential toxicity to humans and other species.</p>

                        <p>Precautions while using pesticides Change clothes and wash your hands immediately after applying pesticides. Before applying a pesticide (indoors or outdoors), remove children, toys and pets from the area and keep them away until the pesticide has dried or as recommended by the label. Remove or cover food during indoor applications.</p>

                        <p>Air-Assisted Electrostatic Sprayer (AAESS) is normally used for agricultural pesticides spraying to protect the crops and orchards from many dreadful insects and diseases. It is basically for reducing the pesticides and environmental pollution with increased efficiency and bio-efficacy.Greeneye Technology has developed a selective spraying system using artificial intelligence to distinguish between weeds and crops, identify weed species and look out for herbicide-resistant ones to ensure that the correct amount of herbicide is applied only when and where needed.</p>
